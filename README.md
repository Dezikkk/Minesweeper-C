## Project Description
This project is an implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, created as a personal educational project. Its main goal was to improve programming skills in the C language and learn best practices in code structuring, dynamic memory management, and implementing logical algorithms.

## Key Features:

* Fully functional Minesweeper game with multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Custom).
* Console-based graphical mode using ANSI colors.
* Intuitive user interface controlled via keyboard (WSAD, Space, F).
* Board management functions, including memory allocation, mine placement, bomb count calculations, and win condition checks.
* Debugging support with a board preview mode (cheat mode).
